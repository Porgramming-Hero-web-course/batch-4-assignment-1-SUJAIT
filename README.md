The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript.

Union and Intersection are fundamental concepts in set theory.Its Uses Programming Various Tarms like Mathematics ,Conditions, and multiple values adding ect works ..

TypeScript Union Types (|) 

Definition : A Union type allow a variable to Hold values of multiple specific types.
For example code : 
type circles ={
    shape:"circle";
    radius:number;
};

type rectangls ={
    shape:"rectangle";
    width:number;
    height:number;
};

type shape = circles | rectangls;


flexibility: Union Types enable function and variable to accept multiple types, making code more fresing and readable versatile and reducing .

Intersection Types (&) 

Definition : Intersection Type combines multiple types into one, so a variable must meet all specified type requiements.
For example Code : 

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Employee = {
  employeeId: number;
  department: string;
};

type PersonEmployee = Person & Employee;

Reusability : They Allow for modular and reusable types , as complex types can be built by combinig simpler ones 


Union and intersection types make typescript code more flexible,maintainable and robust by allowing precise control over type requirements....
